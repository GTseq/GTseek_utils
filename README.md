# GTseek_utils
Utilities for analysis of multiplex amplicon sequencing data

Hi Everyone, 

This is Nate Campbell.  This is a series of perl and python scripts that I've written over the years and have found helpful for analysis of multiplex
PCR libraries such as those created using the GTseq method.  I hope you find these useful.  When attempting to use these scripts, please make sure to
convert to linux line endings for any input files to avoid error messages.  

Cheers,
Nate
